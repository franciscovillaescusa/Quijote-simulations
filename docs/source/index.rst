The Quijote simulations is a suite of more than 82,000 full N-body simulations designed to:

- Quantify the information content on cosmological observables
- Provide enough statistics to train machine learning algorithms

This video shows how changes in the cosmological parameters values affects the cosmic web:

We have run three simulations: 1) with the fiducial Quijote cosmology (shown on the left), 2) with a low value of :math:`\Omega_{\rm m}` equal to 0.2 (shown on the right), and 3) with a high value of the Hubble constant :math:`h` equal to 0.9 (shown on the top after 1 minutes and 15 seconds). The initial phases of the simulations are all the same, and changes are driven by the differences in the value of the cosmological parameters. The simulation with high :math:`h` has been flipped along the x axis to mimick the effect of a mirror along the middle of the screen. The video illustrates how changes in the value of the cosmological parameters induce differences in the positions, masses, and internal properties of dark matter halos. Quijote has been designed to quantify how well can we infer the value of the cosmological parameters given the statistical properties of the cosmic web.
  
Historically, Quijote was developed from the `HADES simulations <https://franciscovillaescusa.github.io/hades.html>`_. Nowadays, it contains the full HADES data.
